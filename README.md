# AWS Architecture Projects

A portfolio of 6 scenario-driven AWS architecture projects, each designed to simulate real-world cloud challenges while aligning with a core domain of the AWS Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate (SAA-C03) certification. These projects demonstrate practical expertise in high availability, serverless design, IAM-based security, cost optimization, observability, and global failover strategies ‚Äî all built with production-grade infrastructure patterns.
